# data_aquisition_fpga
The main objective is to create a real-time temperature monitoring system where data acquisition and pre-processing are handled by real-time *soft-cores* in the FPGA fabric, and high-level communication is managed by the *hard-core* processor. Data is transmitted via Ethernet to a PC and visualized in real-time using **MATLAB**.
